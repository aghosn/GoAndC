# Examples of interactions between Go and C

Code samples to interact with C in a Go program and the other way around.
There are two main folders:
1. *SharedDynamic:* Include code as dynamic library (the makefiles target a Linux environment).
2. *Static:* Statically linked (or compile everything at once).

# How to build

Just type 'make' in the root folder to build all the examples.
Each subfolder also contains its own Makefile that can be used to build only some of the examples.

Note: These code samples are mostly for myself.
